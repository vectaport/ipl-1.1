This software is dual-licensed, under the GPL Version 2 and a
commercial license that was originally sold to Theseus Research Inc.,
and (AFAIK) resold to Wave Semiconductor Inc. in 2009.  This software
distribution contains only the source code originally published under
the GPL by myself in 2009 (before selling the dual license to Theseus
Research Inc.), and subsequent changes done by me since leaving Wave
Semiconductor in 2014.
